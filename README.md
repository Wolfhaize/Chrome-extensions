Digital clock

If you'd like to use this extension for yourself, here's how you will need to set it up:

Clone/download this repository.
If you'd like to further customize it or make any other edits to the page, you will likely want to do that in either the popup.html file or the script.js file.
Once you've made your desired changes (if any), open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
Click the toggle in the upper-right corner marker "Developer Mode".
You should then see three new buttons towards the top of your screen.
Click "Load Unpacked", and then select the folder containing this repository.
